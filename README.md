# DEEP-IMAGE-BLENDING-_PYTHON
Image blending is a method for image composition. It generally refers to cropping a certain region  of a source image (usually an object) and placing it onto the target image at a specified location,  where the goal is to make the composite image look as natural as possible. The challenge of this  task is that the cropped region may not be precisely delineated. Therefore, the blending process  needs to not only adjust the appearance of the cropped object to be compatible with the new  background but also make the cropping boundary appear seamless. The current most popular  method for image blending is Poisson image editing. The idea is to reconstruct pixels in the  blending region such that the blending boundary has smooth pixel transition or small gradients  with respect to the boundary pixels in the target image
